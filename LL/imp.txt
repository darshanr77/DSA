LL

ll is a collection of nodes where each node containes two things
1-> data
2-> node* (node pointer which points to next node) // we are taking pointer bcoz we dont have node like int string char

head is the pointer which points to starting node

data → stores value
next → stores address of next node

node* -> only copy of it will be passed in func
node*& -> used to push pop front mid and end

 head = head->nextPointer;   to jump head to nextnode


 temp = newNode; It DOES NOT change the linked list structure.
 temp->next = newNode; You are changing the structure of the linked list.

 imp

 to remove any node in ll we have to point the node's prev node next to another curr's next node then it get automatically deleted
