// Bubble Sort: Compares adjacent elements and swaps them repeatedly.

// Selection Sort: Selects the minimum element and places it in correct position.

// Insertion Sort: Inserts each element into its correct position in the sorted part.

Bubble Sort- repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. After each pass,

the largest element moves to the end of the array. after each pass the last sorted part is not compared like 4,5 in 1,3,2,5,4


selection sort- selects the min element from unsorted part and places it in its correct position with one swap


Insertion sort- takes one element form unsorted part and places it  in sorted part on the array
